# COADAPT Proactive Entity Recommender

The COADAPT Project releases the code of Proactive Entity Recommender system as open source under the Apache License version 2.0.

The entity recommender tool is implemented as an information management assistant for knowledge work users. The tool includes three core modules: 1) a monitoring system that gathers contextual information in the form of text of the document that the user is examining and manipulating; 2) a intent modeling module to predict user search intent and proactively retrieve entities from distributed information repositories related to the task at hand, as well as process explicit search requests in the context of this task; 3) a user interface (UI) presents recommendation that allow users to effortlessly access to the entities.

Installation instructions are available in the module-specific folders.
